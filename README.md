# Temperature Conversion Made Easy: My Oasis Internship Project

During my internship at Oasis, I created this user-friendly temperature converter web application. This project allowed me to practiceHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and develop my problem-solving skills. The converter supports conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, making it a handy tool for anyone needing to quickly convert temperatures.

I'm excited to share this project and demonstrate my ability to build functional and intuitive web applications."
